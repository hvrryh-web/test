# Model checksum manifest

Record cryptographic checksums for any models stored in this repository. Use this file to verify downloads and avoid keeping large binaries in Git.

| Model | Source | Checksum (SHA256) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| example-model.safetensors | https://example.com/example-model.safetensors | `placeholder-checksum` |

Update this table as new models are added to the `/models` volume.
